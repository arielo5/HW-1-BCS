# Refactoring

## Description
The motivation for this project is to refactor the codebase and be able to meet the standard accesibility of the codebase project. 
The reason why is because the codebase needed an update so that future developers could find every detail of the code more easily.
The reason for that is that the site is better optimize por better search engines.
In this project I learn that there more than one way to better optimize the quality of the existing code without changing the visual aspect of the site.

## Changes
Provided better content elements for each section of the html almost all of the had the <div> element for the body. Added <header>, <footer> in the top and bottom of the body section and inside of the <header> element change the <div> element to a <nav> element since in the header is where the navigation link of the page are. For the top image backgound is under the <figure> element with an alt="marketing meeting" as an alternate name.
