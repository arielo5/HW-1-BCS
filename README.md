# Refactoring

## Description
The motivation for this project is to refactor the codebase and be able to meet the standard accesibility of the codebase project. 
The reason why is because the codebase needed an update so that future developers could find every detail of the code more easily.
The reason for that is that the site is better optimize por better search engines.
In this project I learn that there more than one way to better optimize the quality of the existing code without changing the visual aspect of the site.

## Changes
Provided better content elements for each section of the html almost all of the had the div element for the body. Added header and footer in the top and bottom of the body section and inside of the header element change the div element to a nav element since in the header is where the navigation link of the page are. For the top image backgound is under the figure element with an alt="marketing meeting" as an alternate name, also did the same for every img element in the file with different name in each one. Inside of the main element is divided into 2 section elements one for the left side and another for the right side since each section has ther our class. For each section element the information text and img is under the article element to differentiate each box content.
